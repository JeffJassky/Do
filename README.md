# Flow
Flow is a browser-based productivity tool and philosophy. A simple todo list with the ability to break down our complex projects in to small, digestible actions.

## Philosophy
Procrastination comes from that overwhelming feeling that makes us want to escape. "Flow" is that fulfilling feeling of seamless, fully immersed, energized, fully involved, focus and enjoyment in your actions. Breaking down your projects in to easy, step-by-step actionable items becomes the antidote to procrastination.

## 5 Minute Method
Being in the habit of having a lot of small accomplishments makes approaching your todo list a whole lot less daunting. The more you break down your projects the more little wins you can stack up. Each act should no more than 5 minutes. If a particular action seems like it will take longer it should be broken down further.
