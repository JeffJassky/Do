# Flow
Flow is a browser-based productivity tool and philosophy. A simple todo list with the ability to break down our complex projects in to small, digestible actions.

##Philosophy
Procrastination comes from that overwhelming feeling that makes us want to escape. "Flow" is that fulfilling feeling of seamless, fully immersed, energized, fully involved, focus and enjoyment in your actions. Breaking down your projects in to easy, step-by-step actionable items becomes the antidote to procrastination.

##5 Minute Method
When you get in to a habit of checking off a lot of small actions the idea of approaching your todo list becomes a whole lot less daunting. The more you break down your actions the more little wins you can stack up. Every action we take should no more than 5 minutes. If a particular action seems like it will take longer it should be broken down further.
